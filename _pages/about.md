As I grew older and older, I became more and more conscious of the fact that I still haven’t built anything impressive yet. I thus post this webpage here to keep track of the stuff I’d like to make and to keep my progress updated. May this list of off-the-track tasks bless me with the power to mentally escape the mundaneness of life.

[This Website](https://zoewhat.github.io/) is still under construction. I will revise the writing and try to be more professional with words when I'm ready content-wise.

In `the previous update`, I created this webpage and modified the tags on the hoome page. In `the next update`, I will post the first project, where I create a cyberpunk ink painting with structures in NYC.
